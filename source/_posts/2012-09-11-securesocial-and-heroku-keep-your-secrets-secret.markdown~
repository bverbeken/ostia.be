I'm a contributor on an open source project called [modules.playframework.org](https://github.com/play-modules/modules.playframework.org), a public module repository for playframework that is to replace the [existing modules page](http://www.playframework.org/modules) in the near future. 
We're using the new [SecureSocial](https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial) module for play2 by the ever  helpful Jorge (aka [@jaliss](https://twitter.com/jaliss)) to allow people to log in using 
their twitter, facebook, google and linkedin accounts.
