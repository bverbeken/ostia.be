I've been reading 'Extreme Programming Explained - Embrace Change', by Kent Beck ([@kentbeck](http://twitter.com/kentbeck)). If you've read it too, you're probably thinking: "it's an old book, you should've read it years ago", and I agree. But if you didn't I can only say: you should.
      
Even if you're working on a software development team but are no programmer; XP Explained does not contain any (as in 'zero') code samples, and it's really about how to develop software as a team.

And what better way is there to inspire than by listing up some favorite quotes. 

{% blockquote %}
XP is an opportunity [...] to realize that maybe you've been fine all along and just hanging with the wrong crowd. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
In software development, "perfect" is a verb, not an adjective.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Quality is not a control variable. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
When you're sick, respect yourself and the rest of your team by resting and getting well. [...] Coming in sick doesn't show commitment to work, because when you do you aren't helping the team. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
If you need to work on an idea alone, go do it. [...] When you're done exploring, bring the resulting idea, not the code, back to the team.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Planning is a form of necessary waste.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
In any plan, include some tasks that can be dropped if you get behind. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
You can count on gravity. Software has few such certainties. The ten-minute build is as close as we get. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Any guess about what parts of the system *need* [...] to be tested introduces the risk of error.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Team programming isn't a divide and conquer problem. It's a divide, conquer, and integrate problem. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Test-first programming addresses many problems at once. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Change begins with awareness.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Trust your nose about what you need to improve next.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Any gap between what is on a programmer's desk and what is in production is a risk. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Planning in XP is an activity, not a phase.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
A plan in XP is an example of what *could* happen, not a prediction of what *will* happen.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
The hum of conversation is a sign of health. Silence is the sound of risk piling up. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Whichever units you use, hours or points, you will need to deal with the situation where actual results don't match the plan. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
In XP, testing is as important as programming. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Unfortunately, design in software has been shackled by metaphors from physical design activities.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Even if this is the umpteenth variation on a theme, there is always a better way to design the 
software.
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
The question is not *whether* to design, but *when* to design. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
Far from "design nothing", the XP strategy is "design always".
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
I discover the need for design investment by spotting duplication. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
If you are confronted with a big pile of mud, you can still begin improving the design. 
Why is Taylorism important for software engineering? No one walks around a development shop with a clipboard and a stopwatch. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
"Continuous" learning is not continuous. 
{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}
So the question, "Is my team extreme?" There isn't a binary answer.
{% endblockquote %}

And last but not least: 

{% blockquote %}
The key to XP is integrity, acting in harmony with my true values. 
{% endblockquote %}
