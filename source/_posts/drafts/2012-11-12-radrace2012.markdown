Last friday and saturday, Matti Roloux ([@mroloux](XXX)) and I went to Hasselt to participate in the [Rad Race 2012](XXX), a two-day competition in which teams of two developers build an application from scratch.

The Assignment
-----------------
Unfortunately I can't tell you about the actual content of the project, since we signed a non-disclosure agreement, for obvious reasons. What I can tell you is that the main ideas of any typical business application were there: lots of initial data to import, a complex collection of business rules (that changed during the race), role-based security, batch jobs, etc. 
The assignment was huge. If I were asked to build this application as a real life project, I'd estimate the workload to be 30 mandays or so. We had just 3.

Luckily, this was *not* a real life situation, which allowed us to drop unimportant things like testing :)

It was fun!
