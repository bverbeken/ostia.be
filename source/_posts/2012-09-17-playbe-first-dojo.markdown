PlayFramework
-------------
Play is a full-stack web framework for the JVM that was built from the ground up by web developers who were tired of the bloated enterprizeness of building web apps in java and decided to do something about it.
Last year at devoxx, Zenexity - the company behind Play - announced version PlayFramework 2.0, which was released some months after that. 

Play is exciting. It's got strongly typed templates, asset compilation (javascript, coffeescript, less files and more), it's purely stateless.     
But most important of all: you change your code, hit F5 in the browser and it's there.  
In short, it's the closest thing to PHP you can get as a java/JVM web dev, but without sacrificing your beloved strongly typed objects. 

Ok, I'll admin. I'm a fanboy. 

Play Belgian User Group
------------------------
Again, last year at Devoxx, I met Steve Chalonder (@schaloner), a Welsh expat in Belgium, who had been using Play professionally. He and his teammate managed to rewrite a 4 year project that was ready for the bin in a couple of months, and reduced the LOCs with a factor ten or so.    
Steve is also the author of Deadbolt, an amazing authorization module for both Play 1 and 2.    
Now, being a fanboy is not much fun if you're the only one. Or even two. 
So Steve and I decided to form a user group, 

Now, a couple of months and beer sessions later, we're very proud to be organizing our first *real* event: a **Play2 & Java coding dojo**. 


Dojo
--------
One of the things that makes a good developer great is practice. Being a generalizing specialist XXX LINK XXX is another. 
There, that's two reasons to not miss this event:  



Conclusion
------------
Don't miss this opportunity to become a better developer and to Play.
