The  Belgian Playframework User Group held it's first coding event yesterday, and if you ask me, it went well. The ingrediÃ«nts: 17 people, a nice room, food and drinks (thank you Cegeka!), and Playframework of course.

A Coding Dojo is an event where people gather to code and learn together. The goal of a dojo is exactly that: to code and learn, nothing more. The resulting application is not what it's about.   
Ours was a XXX dojo, a special dojo format in w
 




WHen I arrived at the Cegeka offices in the afternoon, the room was free, so I decided to get myself a seat and prepare some more.  

Table placement
--------------------

The wireless keyboard thing worked. Also, the fact we were sitting around tables in a in a big U-shape clearly helped interaction. 

Timing: 
-----------
If you do a dojo, timing is important. A very obvious thing only occurred to me during the dojo: 


Keyboard
-------------
In a 'normal' XXX dojo, there's two people pair programing in front of the room on a laptop, while the rest of the participants follow on the big screen. Every x minutes, one of the pairs is swapped with someone from the audience, and at the end of the evening everybody should have coded at least once. 
 
We did it slightly different. When I arrived at the Cegeka offices in the afternoon, the room was free so I put myself in a chair started hacking. I noticed that the wireless keyboard I brought actually worked if I moved to the back of the room. 

The keyboard was passed along from left to right (or right to left, depending on your viewpoint). Result was that everything became very predictable: people at the end of the U knew they wouldn't have to code before some time, and the ones who coded in the beginning of the evening quickly knew their turn had passed.    
Perhaps we need to make it a bit less predictable next time. 

When doing a dojo, make sure the first person to code knows at least a bit about the technology. It's very hard for a complete newbie to just start working

IDE war

It's an eternal war, and it can't be won.
Neither 

I'm an IntelliJ fan, always been one, but I respect other people's choice (even if there really is no competition)
